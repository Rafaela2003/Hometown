      <h3> History Page </h3>
      <p> This page elaborates on the historical events regarding Faro as a part of Portugal and the lore of the munciplicity. </p>

      <p> The first settlement came about in the fourth century when the area was known as Ossonoba. At the time it was known as a commercial port for agriculture. In the 9th century after a revolt it became the capital of a short lived princedom and was named Santa Maria. After that Faro was under Moorish rule who were then defeated and expelled by King Afonso III. The town then became popular for the exploitation of salt with artisans contributing heavily to the economy and city development. In addition to this in 1755 the Lisbon Earthquake caused a tsunami that effected coastal area however, Faro was protected due to the sandy banks of the Ria Formosa. </p>
