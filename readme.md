The reason that I designed my website the way I did is because I wanted to go for a simplistic website that would be easy for the user to navigate as the user is able to quickly identify where the navigation tools are such as the tabs and widgets. In addition to this the colours are fairly light in order to put emphasis on the text on the web page and not distract the user from that with colours that are too bright. The layout is easy to follow and is similar to that typically used in other websites which is so the user finds no challenges when navigating the website. 
Challenges that were faced included the addition of an image as a banner as several images attempted were not compatible with the flexible structure provided by Bootstrap which created an unappealing image. Furthermore, another challenge faced was including the map in a manner which I would have preferred so that it did not occupy the whole page. Due to lack of indentation it would often fail however I managed to include it in a ration that I wanted. It was also difficult to add the images within the collapsibles due to the small area of the screen that it occupies.
